## INSTALLATION:
Download Noesis from here: https://www.richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php&showproject=91
Once it is installed, navigate to your [Noesis Installation Path]/plugins/python folder and put fmt_RE_MESH.py in there, and re-launch the program.
Opening a mesh or tex file with Noesis will automatically load it, once the plugin is installed. 
## NOESIS MAXSCRIPT:
To use the optional Noesis Maxscript (REEM Noesis CMD), you should edit the included .ms file to tell it where your Noesis.exe is. 
Then you can run the maxscript in 3dsMax with Scripts -> Run Script, and use it to remote-control Noesis as to seamlessly import and export with a GUI inside 3dsmax.
